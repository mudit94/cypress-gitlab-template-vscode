## Release Notes



### 1.0.0

Initial release of Cypress Framework Generator with Allure Reporting & Gitlab Ci

Inspired from the playwright development, I have  created a one click generate template for cypress.
This template would help initialize a cypress 12.14.0 project with the required files along with allure report generation.
It also helps in generating .gitlab-ci.yml file for running the tests in gitlab ci
