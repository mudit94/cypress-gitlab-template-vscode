\!\[Allure Report]\(images/allure.png\)

> Tip: Many popular extensions utilize animations. This is an excellent way to show off your extension! We recommend short, focused animations that are easy to follow.

## Requirements

If you have any requirements or dependencies, add a section describing those and how to install and configure them.


## Known Issues

Calling out known issues can help limit users opening duplicate issues against your extension.

## Release Notes

Users appreciate release notes as you update your extension.

### 1.0.0

Initial release of Cypress Framework Generator with Allure Reporting & Gitlab Ci

Inspired from the playwright development, I have  created a one click generate template for cypress.
This template would help initialize a cypress 12.14.0 project with the required files along with allure report generation.
It also helps in generating .gitlab-ci.yml file for running the tests in gitlab ci
